# Picassol - A Collaborative Canvas on Solana

Welcome to Picassol, a groundbreaking project leveraging the Solana blockchain to create a collaborative digital canvas. This initiative enables participants from across the globe to add their touch to a 200x200 pixel canvas by executing transactions on the Solana network. Each pixel change represents an individual's contribution, piecing together a mosaic of community and innovation.

**Note:** Picassol currently operates on the Solana Devnet, not the Mainnet. This environment allows for testing and development without the cost implications of the Mainnet, making it easier for users to participate and contribute.

## Features

- **Decentralized Artwork**: A canvas of 200x200 pixels open for anyone to contribute, underpinned by the robust Solana blockchain technology.
- **Pixel Transactions**: Change the color of pixels through Solana transactions, enabling real-time collaborative art.
- **Real-Time Canvas Updates**: Watch the canvas evolve with each transaction, displaying the collective creativity of participants worldwide.
- **Permanent Contributions**: Every pixel color set and confirmed on the blockchain remains an immutable testament to the contributor's participation.

## Getting Started

To join the Picassol canvas, ensure you have a Solana wallet and a small amount of SOL to cover transaction fees. Follow these steps to make your mark:
